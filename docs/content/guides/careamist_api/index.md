# CAREamist API

The CAREamist API is the recommended way to use CAREamics, it is a two stage process, in
which users first define a configuration and then use a the `CAREamist` to run their 
training and prediction.

## Quick start

The simplest way to use CAREamics is to create a configuration using the [convenience functions](configuration/convenience_functions.md). Checkout the [applications](../../applications/index.md) section for real-world examples of the various algorithms.

=== "Noise2Void"
    
    ```python
    --8<-- "careamist_api.py:quick_start_n2v"
    ```

    1. Obviously, choose a more realistic number of epochs for training.

    2. Use real data for training!


=== "CARE"

    ```python
    --8<-- "careamist_api.py:quick_start_care"
    ```

    1. Obviously, choose a more realistic number of epochs for training.

    2. Use real data for training! Here, we added validation data as well.


=== "Noise2Noise"

    ```python
    --8<-- "careamist_api.py:quick_start_n2n"
    ```

    1. Obviously, choose a more realistic number of epochs for training.

    2. Use real data for training!


## Documentation

There are many features that can be useful for your application, explore the
documentation to learn all the various aspects of CAREamics.

    The configuration is at the heart of CAREamics, it allows users to define how and
    which algorithm will be trained.

    ---

    The CAREamist is the core element allowing training and prediction using the model
    defined in the configuration.
